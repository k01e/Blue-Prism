Here are some objects that I've created or updated.

# Azure Storage #

Code Stages for actions for interaction with the Azure Storage Service.

# MS Word VBO #

I took the standard MS Word VBO and updated the GetBody actions. So instead of specifiying the finish range you can choose "0" and it'll grab the end of the range (Range.End).

# Utility - JSON #  

Adding additional action to use json path to the standard Utility - JSON VBO.
